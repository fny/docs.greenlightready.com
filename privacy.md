# Greenlight Privacy Policy

## Overview

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Greenlight, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We only ask for the personal information that we need to connect you to services, and to  create a safe environment for you to work, learn, and live.
- We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
- You grant organizations permission to access your Greenlight status updates. You can stop sharing updates at any time.
- You can permanently delete your data at any time.
- We protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
- We will be fully transparent on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

- Our websites (including greenlightready.com, greenlighted.org, greenlightdurham.com);
- Our mobile applications;

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Greenlight. Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect and use information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

## Creative Commons Sharealike License

This Privacy Policy is based on Automattic's open source policy which is available under a [Creative Commons Share-alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic). This Privacy Policy is distributed under the same license. You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, please give credit to Automattic somewhere on your site.

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to create safe places to learn, live, and work, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, to support efforts at public health departments, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources such as your school or employer. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

## Information You Provide to Us

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

- **Basic account information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Greenlight account to provide a mobile number, zip code, and password — and that’s it. We require these three pieces of information to be able to contact you, to ensure that you are directed to local resources most relevant to you, and so that you can securely use Greenlight. You may provide us with more information — like your email address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to use Greenlight. In fact, you are free to use an anonymous name if you wish.
- **Daily check-in information:** Every day, you will be asked a series of questions related to COVID-19 symptoms, exposures, and testing. These questions will align with public health guidance in your geographic location. Based on responses to these questions, we assign you a Greenlight status that is green, yellow, or pink. You can grant permission to an organization (e.g., school, employer) to be able to access your Greenlight status. Your responses to questions in the app are not shared with anyone. You can revoke this permission at any time.
- **Social service request information:** As a Greenlight user, you will have the option to submit a social service request to a local community based organization or faith based organization that is active in your area. These organizations have community health workers or social workers who are available to help connect you to services. We store information about your social service request so that we can follow up with you to ensure that you receive the services you need. We delete data related to your request after 30 days.
- **Payment and contact information:** If you buy something from us, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. More specifically, you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.
- **Communications with us (hi there!):** You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our support staff about a support question, communicate with our Community Health Workers about a need, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, video chat, or otherwise, we may store a copy of our communications. Additionally, we do often record our webinars and digital town halls so that we can share them with the broader community.
- **Job applicant information:** If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.

## Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect some information automatically:

- **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you submit a survey on our app. We use this information to protect our Services from malicious actors, to render browser specific services, and to help you when there is a technical issue in our application.
- **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that location administrators and users perform on a site using Greenlight — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [Greenlight user id] submitted a symptom survey for [other Greenlight user id] at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to provide, for example, our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and to detect malicious behaviors. This audit trail is critical for us to ensure no one is manipulating check-in data.
- **Location information:** We require you to enter your Zip code to use Greenlight so that we can ensure that you are connected to local resources that are relevant to you. Beyond that, you are not required to provide any additional location information. We may ask for more specific location information for certain optional services (showing nearby test sites on a map, for example), but this is not required and will require your explicit permission..
- **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s browser and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Greenlight uses cookies to store an encrypted authentication token so you don't have to sign in when you visit our sites and to store information about certain features in the app such as your language preference or whether you've dismissed a message.

## How and Why We Use Information

### Purposes for Using Information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide customer service, connect you to relevant services, process payments, and verify user information.
- **To notify locations with which you are associated.** For example, by notifying an employer or school administrator that you approve about your Greenlight status or any information you chose to share with them.
- **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy or make our Services easier to use.
- **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Greenlight and its partners.
- **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
- **To deliver specific Services you need.** For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant content and notifications based on your status and provide your with access to the services you need during a social services request.
- **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of Greenlight, or keep you up to date on programs and services in your area; texting, email, or sending a push notification to remind you to complete your daily check-in. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of newsletters and communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

### Sharing Information

#### How We Share Information

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below:

- **With your organizations:** You can consent to  share your daily Greenlight status (green, yellow, pink) with an organization, such as your employer or a school you are affiliated with. Some organizations will require daily check-in’s to participate in on-premise activities. Organizations you share your Greenlight status with do not have access to your specific responses to daily check-in questions. At any time, you can revoke permission for an organization to access your daily Greenlight status.
- **With community-based, faith-based, and other care worker organizations:** Through Greenlight, you will be able to submit a request for health, social, and other services such as COVID-19 relief payments. All information that you submit in those requests will be available to the partner organization that you will work with to access the services you need.
- **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a public health request, subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
- **Third-party vendors:** Any third-party vendor you interact with through our site may receive your basic account information, such as your email or phone number. For example, the help desk software we use is Help Scout. If you send a support request, Help Scout will receive your name, email, and phone number. Similarly, if you sign up for a newsletter, we will share your email with the software used to distribute the newsletter. Organizations who use our applications, like schools, may have the organization’s name listed in the different support documents.
- **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Greenlight, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay. For example, if you report to our hotline that you are being attacked, we may contact emergency services to help you.
- **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the number of COVID-19 cases in a city.

We have a long-standing policy to not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies.

#### Information Shared Publicly

Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. When you as a business owner create your location, for example, your location’s information is used to create a registration page that we present to users. This information will be publicly accessible.

Additionally, we may from time to time, make recordings of our webinars and digital town halls so that we can share them with the broader community. Anything you say in those public forums may appear online.

Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

### How Long We Keep Information

By default, we delete information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. We only store detailed data related to social service requests and logging information for 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, have enough data to comply with public health requests and to analyze traffic to Greenlight’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Our cloud provider has been certified against this set of widely recognized and internationally accepted information security standards that specifies security management best practices and comprehensive security controls following ISO 27002. These certifications also cover information security specific to the cloud and the protection of Personally Identifiable Information.

### HIPAA and FERPA Compliance

Since Greenlight is not a covered entity and it is not subcontracted by a covered entity, Greenlight is not required by law to comply with HIPAA. However, we have gone to great lengths to ensure a similar grade of security across all our Services. Namely,

- Our applications run on a HIPAA-compliant cloud infrastructure
- We have signed BAAs with many third-party services that we use
- We have internal data security protocols that meet the HIPAA standards

Additionally, since we work with school data, we have taken care to comply with FERPA. Please note that student health data is governed by FERPA due to the FERPA exception written in HIPAA.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

- **Limit the information that you provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible. You may also choose to provide false information to obscure your identity, such as a pseudonym. We take no issue with this. However, be aware that you might complicate efforts for others that may need that information. For example, if you chose to use a pseudonym for your child, a school may have difficulty clearing your child for in-person attendance. If you choose to use a pseudonym, we recommend that you communicate with those who need to know for Greenlight to operate smoothly.
- **Limit the organizations you share data with:** Many organizations, such as schools and employers, are using Greenlight to create safe environments to live, learn, and work. These organizations may require daily screening to ensure that the risk of COVID-19 transmission to individuals participating in on-premise activities is minimal. You can agree to share your daily Greenlight status with an organization and you can revoke this sharing at any time.
- **Opt out of notifications and communications:** You may opt out of receiving communications and notifications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of public health communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
- **Delete your account:** We understand that by participating in Greenlight, you are taking a risk to store information about you. While we take every precaution to minimize the risk of private information about you being shared, we understand a time may come when you want to delete your account and all data associated with you. Don’t worry, you can do this at any time.

## Additional Rights

If you are located in California you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

#### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:

- Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
- Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
- Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);
- Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
- Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
- Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
- Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and
- Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:

- Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;
- Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
- Opt out of any sale of personal information; and
- Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

#### Contacting Us About These Rights

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “How to Reach Us” to, well, find out how to reach us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.

## How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us via email at hello@greenlightready.com.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Greenlight may change its Privacy Policy. Greenlight encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or the [Greenlight Blog](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/greenlightready&sa=D&ust=1608953562916000&usg=AOvVaw1MMHA6Dxw_HffiJctu5UAW) or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.

## Translation

Our Privacy Policy was originally written in English (US). We may translate it into other languages.

In the event of a conflict between a translated version of our Privacy Policy and the English version, the English version will control.

That’s it! Thanks for reading.
