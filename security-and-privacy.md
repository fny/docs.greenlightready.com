# Security & Privacy

Greenlight holds security and privacy as two of its core values. Combined with our commitment to transparency, we work to make our practices both public and human readable—not some incredibly dense legalese. We also encourage our users to contact us if they have concerns about our practices and have suggestions for improvement.

### We Aspire to High Standards

We developed our security practices based on guidance from the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/), [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html), and [FERPA](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/data-security-checklist). While we are not legally obligated to be HIPAA compliant, we have adopted many of the security standards and run Greenlight on HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure provided to us by Salesforce. Additionally, we have agreements with many of the third parties we work with that require them to operate in a HIPAA compliant fashion.

### Your Data is Always Encrypted

Whenever your data is stored or is in transit it's always encrypted. This applies to all of our application databases, file storage, and logs. We use HTTPS to send you data directly. Within our firewalled private networks, all data is encrypted. We only use modern encryption protocols that have no known vulnerabilities.

### Redundancy

All of our servers operate with high levels of redundancy and backups in place to ensure uptime. At most, our systems can tolerate up to 15 minutes of downtime in any given month. All data is backed up as well in case of catastrophic failures.

### Privacy Practices

We are commit to strong safegaurds to protect you privacy. You can learn more by reading our [Privacy Policy](https://greenlightready.com/privacy). Some highlights:

- We do not use any third-party analytics software like Google Analytics
- We do not use any social media integrations that would result in your data being tracked
- All of our employees and contractors undergo a training to understand what we do even though most of them have no access to our data
- You can choose to use our services anonymously if you wish
- We will not use your data for advertising or marketing

Note that we may be required to provide information to government entities such as a public health department, but we'll also fight to ensure that the government is not overstepping its boundaries.

### We Monitor Our Employees, Not You

We log who does everything in our backend system systems. All information typed into our backed is logged. We know exactly who has access what data and when. Additionally, we restrict the number of people who have access to sensitive data to the minimum required and train them to ensure they respect your rights.

### Security Certifications

Our cloud infrastructure provider, Heroku, regularly performs audits and maintains PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance to further strengthen our trust with customers.

- **PCI DSS Level 1**: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a widely understood and accepted security standard for cardholder data.
- **ISO 27001**: A widely recognized and internationally accepted information security standard that specifies security management best practices and comprehensive security controls following ISO 27002 best practices guidance.
- **ISO 27017**: A standard that provides additional guidance and implementation advice on information security aspects specific to cloud computing.
- **ISO 27018**: Establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls and guidelines for implementing measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance with defined privacy principles for public cloud computing environments.
- **SOC1 Type 2**: An independent examination of the IT General controls and controls around availability, confidentiality and security of customer data processed by the Heroku Platform relevant for the financial reporting of customers.
- **SOC2 Type 2**: The restricted to use SOC2 Type 2 report is an independent examination of the fairness of presentation and the suitability of the design of controls relevant to security, availability and confidentiality of the customer data processed by the Heroku Platform.
- **SOC3**: The general use SOC3 report is an independent examination of the fairness of presentation and the suitability of the design of controls relevant to security, availability and confidentiality of the customer data processed by the Heroku Platform.

### Data Retention

We strive to retain the least amount of data necessary to operate Greenlight. As such, delete our logs ever 30 days, if not sooner. We have adopted HIPAAs stance on personally identifiable information: when your information is no longer required, it will be disposed of securely ensuring that the data is  “unreadable, indecipherable, and otherwise cannot be reconstructed.” Since we do provide your status information to locations, such as schools or businesses that you authorize, you will need to talk to them about how they plan to retain and protect the data.

### Breach Notifications

A breach is defined as a use or disclosure of protected health information not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule that compromises the security or privacy of protected health information. Notifications are not required if a HIPAA-covered entity or business associate can demonstrate there is a low probability that PHI has been compromised, with that determination made through a risk analysis.

If notifications are required, they must be issued to patients/health plan members ‘without unnecessary delay’ and no later than 60 days after the discovery of a breach. A media notice must also be issued if the breach impacts more than 500 individuals, again within 60 days. The notice should be provided to a prominent media outlet in the state or jurisdiction where the breach victims are located.

The individual and media notices should include a brief description of the security breach, the types of information exposed, a brief description of what is being done by the breached entity to mitigate harm and prevent future breaches, and the steps that can be taken by breach victims to reduce the potential for harm.

The HHS’ Secretary must also be notified within 60 days of the discovery of a breach if the breach impacts 500 or more individuals, and within 60 days of the end of the calendar year in which the breach was experienced if the breach impacts fewer than 500 individuals.

A copy of the breach notices should be retained along with documentation showing that notifications were issued. If a security breach did not warrant the issuing of notifications, documentation must be retained detailing the risk assessment that established there was a low probability that PHI was compromised.

### Third-party Services We Use
