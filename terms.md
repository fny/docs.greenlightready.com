# Greenlight Terms of Service

## The Gist

We (the folks at [Greenlight](https://greenlightready.com)) are on a mission to help communities grow stronger during the COVID-19 Pandemic and beyond. We hope you love our products and services as much as we love creating them.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions.

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

These Terms of Service will apply when you use our services including:

- Our websites (including greenlightready.com, greenlighted.org, greenlightdurham.com);
- Our mobile applications;

Throughout these Terms, we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain what you are agreeing to by using these services as well as what rights you will have as a user. As a parent or guardian, you may be using our services on behalf of a child. By using these services in such a capacity, you also will be agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your child.

In addition to these terms, please also review our [Privacy Policy](https://greenlightready.com/privacy) to understand what we do with any information we collect.

## Who's Who

Throughout these Terms we will reference different groups. Let’s define them now:

- “You” or “yourself” means any individual or entity using our Services (for instance the person completing the survey!)
- “Community” or “Communities” applies to any of the different organizations we work with, for example schools, colleges, universities, businesses, and nonprofits.
- “Greenlight”, “we”, or “us” refers to Greenlight Ready LLC

If you are using our services on behalf of an entity, another individual, or minor (person under the age of 18), you are accepting these terms on their behalf.

## Your Account

To use our services, you may be required to create an “Account”. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an Account and to keep the information current. This will be important if we need to share notable updates with you (such as updates to our Terms!).

### Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for maintaining your Account in the following capacities:

- **Security:** You are required to maintain up to date contact information (email or mobile), keep your password safe. You also may not share or misuse your Account. You are also required to maintain the same information for your Account on any Service-related website to which Greenlight may refer you. We understand accidents happen; please notify us immediately if your Account has been compromised. We are not responsible for any Account misuse including any damages that result from such action.
- **Proper Use:** You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. We do not condone sharing and misusing Greenlight Accounts for actions outside the scope of Greenlight’s purpose.
- **Proper Authorization:** If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using using our Services you’re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

When you create a Greenlight account, we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it’s an email, phone call, or text message.

### Minimum Age Requirements & Minor Use

Individuals under the age of 18 should not use the Service unless they are a member of a Community using Greenlight that allows a parent or legal guardian to register the individual under these Terms. If you allow a minor to, or give minor access to, use the Service, you hold responsibility for ensuring that the use of the Service by the minor is in compliance with the Terms regardless of whether or not such use was authorized.

### Charges and Refunds

**Charges for Users.** If you are using Greenlight as a user of a registered Community, there is no fee charged to use the Greenlight App. There may be outside charges associated with healthcare or testing services you are referred to through use of the Greenlight App and Service. Greenlight is not responsible for any charges or payments associated with such services.

**Charges for Communities.** Communities may be charged to use the Greenlight App. If you would like to request a refund or inquire about pricing please contact us at hello@greenlightready.com.

## Access to the Greenlight App

**License.** If you decide to use any part of the Greenlight App or Greenlight Services, we give you a limited license to use and access the Greenlight App and Service solely for your own use.

**Certain Restrictions.** While you are granted the rights laid out in these Terms when using the GreenLight App and Service, you are also subject to the following restrictions:

### User Data, Privacy, Disclosures, and HIPAA Waiver

#### User Data

We define “User Data” as all the information that a user enters or uses when operating the Greenlight App or Service, including the user’s responses to their health status and daily symptom questionnaires. You will provide accurate User Data when requested or required by the Greenlight App or Service and acknowledge all the risks that are associated with the use of your User Data. You agree that your User Data or any other information that you provide to us does not violate our Acceptable Use Policy (outlined below). Greenlight is not required to ensure that User Data is backed up and has the right to delete it at any time without notice.

#### Feedback

We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we’re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.

#### Disclosure, Authorizations, and HIPAA Waiver

We may provide User Data and any other data generated through the Greenlight App or Service to the administrators of your Community. This User Data may be used by the Community Administration to make decisions regarding you or your minor’s use of Community facilities and participation in Community activities such as school and work. These decisions are solely made by the Community and Greenlight is not responsible for them in any way. Under the Federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), Greenlight is considered a “school official” meaning that it has the right to assist Communities in monitoring COVID-19 within its population and assist the Community with its decision-making. Under FERPA parents and guardians are able to review certain aspects of their minor’s information including restricting the further use or collection of such data or deleting such data. You should contact your Community if you wish to exercise your rights under FERPA. Please note that your Community must be an educational institution receiving federal funding for FERPA to apply.

Greenlight is not considered a “covered entity” under the Healthcare Insurance Portability And Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) meaning that User Data will not be subject to HIPAA requirements and regulations.

The Greenlight App or Service may direct you to contact, link to, or communicate with a telehealth or other healthcare provider (a “Provider”). The use of such a Provider is completely voluntary and you have the option to contact and use your own healthcare provider for any necessary services such as testing , treatment, and follow-up. If you contact a Provider through the Service, you allow us to disclose your personal information and User Data to this Provider. You may also allow your Provider to provide Greenlight any information regarding testing, treatment for COVID-19, vaccination, or other health information (“Health Data”). Greenlight has permission to provide the Health Data to the Community for use in accordance with its policies. Once this information is disclosed it can be re-disclosed by the recipient of the information without HIPAA protection. Greenlight does not control how a Health Care Provider or the Community may make use of or disclose User Data or Health Data. Health Data, including positive COVID-19 results, will be submitted to local, state, and federal agencies as required under the applicable local, state, and federal regulations. You can withdraw this permission at any time to prevent your information from being used for such purposes in the future.

### Use of the Service

**License.** You grant Greenlight a license to reproduce and display your User Data in regards to the services provided (for example if we need to show a school you are associated with comments you send us or symptom status data). Your User Data may be analyzed through the Service and provided to applicable Health Care Providers and Communities.

**Acceptable Use Policy.** The following indicates the terms of our “Acceptable Use Policy”:

- You agree not to use the Greenlight App or the Service to collect, upload, transmit, display, or distribute any User Data (i) that violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) that is unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of another’s privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive, promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual or is otherwise objectionable; (iii) that is harmful to minors in any way; or (iv) that is in violation of any law, regulation, or obligations or restrictions imposed by any third party.

## Healthcare Provider Links, Other Users, and Communities

### Healthcare Provider Links

The Service may contain links to third-party Healthcare Provider websites and services (“Provider Links”).

Greenlight provides access to these Healthcare Providers only as a convenience to you, and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to such Healthcare Providers. You should use all Provider Links at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Provider Links, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction using such Provider Links or any Healthcare Provider.

### Other Users

Each Service user is solely responsible for any and all of its own User Data. Because we do not control User Data, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Data, whether provided by you or by others. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Data, or the results generated by the Service using such User Data.

### Communities

You understand and agree that the Community is responsible for establishing its own policies regarding tracking and monitoring of COVID 19 symptoms and cases, containment of any illnesses or determining attendance and absence requirements and policies.

## Dispute Resolution

Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Greenlight and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

1. **Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Greenlight that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Greenlight, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
2. **Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.** Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Greenlight should be sent to the Greenlight attn..: Terms of Use Dispute at the address listed in Section 10.8 (or such other address as may be provided by the Greenlight for this purpose. After the Notice is received, you and Greenlight may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Greenlight do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
3. **Arbitration.** You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising hereunder or relating in any way to these Terms and not informally resolved shall be settled by binding arbitration in Raleigh, North Carolina, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitrator shall issue a written decision specifying the basis for the award made. The party filing a claim or counterclaim in the arbitration proceeding shall pay the deposit(s) determined by AAA with respect to such claim or counterclaim. All other costs associated with the arbitration and imposed by AAA shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator(s) and, in absence of such determination, equally by each party to the arbitration.  In addition, unless the arbitrator awards payment of reasonable attorney and other fees to a party, each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for its own attorneys' fees and other professional fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. Determinations of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of North Carolina, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules.
   1. **Waiver of Jury Trial.** THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Greenlight in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND GREENLIGHT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
   2. **Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.** ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
   3. **Confidentiality.** All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
   4. **Severability.** If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
   5. **Right to Waive.** Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
   6. **Emergency Equitable Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
   7. **Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
   8. **Courts.** In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Wake County, North Carolina, for such purpose
4. **Statute of Limitations.**  You and  Greenlight both agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Greenlight App or Service or these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) must be filed within ONE (1) YEAR after such claim or cause of action arose or will be forever barred.

### Export

The Service may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from the Greenlight, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

### Disclosures

If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

**Electronic Communications.**

The communications between you and Greenlight use electronic means, whether you use the Service or send us emails, or whether Greenlight posts notices on the Service or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Greenlight in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Greenlight provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### Entire Terms

These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Greenlight App and Service. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation.” If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Greenlight’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Greenlight may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
